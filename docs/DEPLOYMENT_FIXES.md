# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Solutions

### 1. Project Name Issue
**Problem**: Directory name "SignatureQuoteCrawler" contains uppercase letters, which Vercel doesn't allow for project names.

**Solution**: 
- The package.json already has the correct lowercase name "signature-quote-crawler"
- When deploying, Vercel should use the package.json name instead of directory name
- If issues persist, consider renaming the directory to lowercase

### 2. Puppeteer/Chromium Configuration
**Problem**: PDF generation uses Puppeteer with @sparticuz/chromium which can cause deployment issues.

**Current Configuration**:
- Uses `@sparticuz/chromium` for Vercel deployment
- Has proper fallback to local puppeteer for development
- Configured with proper args and executable path

**Status**: âœ… Already properly configured

### 3. File System Access Issues
**Problem**: Some API routes use `fs.readFileSync` which may not work in Vercel's serverless environment.

**Affected Files**:
- `app/api/enhanced-products/route.ts`
- `app/api/signature-solar/route.ts`

**Solution**: These routes already have proper fallbacks for when files don't exist.

### 4. Environment Variables
**Required Environment Variables**:
- Database connection (Neon/PostgreSQL)
- Gmail API credentials
- NextAuth configuration
- Stripe configuration

### 5. Build Configuration
**Current Status**:
- Next.js 14.2.15 with App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Proper build command: `next build`
- Puppeteer skip chromium download: `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy using the correct project name from package.json
3. Monitor build logs for any remaining issues
4. Test PDF generation and email functionality after deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are properly set
3. Ensure database connection is working
4. Test API endpoints individually
