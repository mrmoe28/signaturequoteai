# Feature: Stable PDF Generation

## What This Feature Does

This feature generates professional PDF documents for quotes using React-PDF instead of Puppeteer. It creates beautifully formatted quote documents with company branding, itemized line items, totals, and terms & conditions. The system automatically handles both successful PDF generation and graceful fallbacks to simple text-based PDFs if needed.

## How to Use This Feature

Users can generate PDFs in two ways:
1. **Direct PDF Download**: Click the "Download PDF" button on any quote page (`/quotes/[id]`)
2. **Email with PDF**: Send a quote via email with PDF attachment using the "Send Quote" button

The system automatically:
- Fetches quote data from the database
- Applies company branding and settings
- Generates a professional PDF with proper formatting
- Handles errors gracefully with fallback options

## Implementation Notes

**Core Components:**
- `lib/pdf-generator-stable.tsx` - Main PDF generation service
- `lib/pdf-generator-react.tsx` - React PDF document component
- `app/api/quotes/[id]/pdf/route.ts` - PDF download endpoint
- `app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts` - Email with PDF endpoint

**Dependencies:**
- `@react-pdf/renderer` - For PDF generation (replaces Puppeteer)
- React components for document structure
- TypeScript for type safety

**Key Features:**
- Serverless-friendly (works on Vercel)
- Type-safe implementation
- Professional styling with company branding
- Automatic error handling and fallbacks
- Support for line items, totals, and customer information

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Generate PDF for a quote
const pdfBuffer = await generateQuotePDF(quote);

// The PDF includes:
// - Company header with logo and contact info
// - Quote number and date
// - Customer billing and shipping information
// - Itemized line items with quantities and prices
// - Subtotal, tax, and total calculations
// - Terms and conditions

```
