## 🚀 Next Steps: Get More Products & Images

Your database is seeded with initial products, but you'll want to run the **crawler** to fetch hundreds more products with images from Signature Solar.

### Quick Start Crawler

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (required first!)
npm install

# 2. Run full crawler
npm run crawl:start

# This will:
# ✅ Fetch 200-500+ products from Signature Solar
# ✅ Download product images and specifications
# ✅ Update prices automatically
# ✅ Create price history snapshots
```

### Alternative: Test First

```bash
# Test crawler on single product
npm run crawl:test

# Then run full crawl
npm run crawl:start
```

## 🔍 Verification

### Run These Commands to Verify

```bash
# Check product count
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;"

# View all products
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT id, name, price, category FROM products;"

# Check company settings
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT * FROM company_settings;"
```

### Expected Output

```
Products: 4 ✅
Company Settings: 1 ✅
Images: 0 (run crawler to fetch)
```

## 📊 Migration Workflow

```
1. ✅ Created NeonDB connection
2. ✅ Set up database schema (8 tables)
3. ✅ Created seed scripts (SQL, JS, TS)
4. ✅ Imported 4 products from catalog.json
5. ✅ Initialized company settings
6. ⏳ Next: Run crawler for more products
```

## 🎨 Images Status

**Current:** 0 products with images
**Reason:** Initial seed data doesn't include image URLs

**Solution:** Run the crawler to fetch products with images:

```bash
npm run crawl:start
```

The crawler will:
- Scrape Signature Solar website
- Fetch product CDN image URLs
- Store images array in JSON format
- Update `primary_image_url` field

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Dependencies Not Installed?

```bash
# If npm install fails, use SQL seed directly:
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f scripts/seed-products.sql
```

### Want to Add More Products Manually?

Edit `lib/seed/catalog.json` and re-run:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f scripts/seed-products.sql
```

### Need to Reset Database?

```bash
# Drop all data (careful!)
npm run db:drop

# Re-run migrations
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f lib/db/migrations/0000_odd_quasar.sql
# ... (run all migrations)

# Re-seed
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f scripts/seed-products.sql
```

## ✨ You're Ready!

Your database is set up and seeded. Here's what you can do now:

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Create Your First Quote

1. Go to `/products` to see the 4 products
2. Go to `/quotes/new` to create a quote
3. Add products and generate PDF

### 3. Run Crawler for More Products

```bash
npm install  # If not done yet
npm run crawl:start
```

### 4. Configure Company Info

Update company settings in the app or database:

```sql
UPDATE company_settings SET
  company_name = 'Your Company',
  company_email = 'you@company.com',
  company_phone = '(123) 456-7890'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM company_settings LIMIT 1);
```
