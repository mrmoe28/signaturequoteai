## 🗄️ Database Configuration

### Your .env.local is Already Configured

```bash
# Already pointing to the new database:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_vqzMmGf72jkX@ep-floral-butterfly-add12tu0-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

**No changes needed!** Your app will use the new database automatically.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Application

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Visit:
# - http://localhost:3000/products (228 products with images!)
# - http://localhost:3000/quotes (34 existing quotes)
# - http://localhost:3000/quotes/new (create new quotes)
```

### 2. Verify Everything Works

- ✅ View all 228 products with images
- ✅ Open and view existing quotes
- ✅ Create new quotes
- ✅ Generate PDF quotes
- ✅ Check company settings

### 3. Update Vercel (When Ready)

When you're ready to deploy, update Vercel environment variables:

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_vqzMmGf72jkX@ep-floral-butterfly-add12tu0-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
# Paste the new DATABASE_URL when prompted
```

# Expected: 228
```

### Check Quotes

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quotes;"
# Expected: 34
```

### View Products with Images

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT COUNT(*) as with_images
  FROM products
  WHERE primary_image_url IS NOT NULL;
"
# Expected: 216
```
