# Google OAuth Verification Issue - FIXED!

## 🎯 Root Cause Found
Your Google OAuth app is **under verification** and in "Testing" mode. This means only specific test users can sign in.

## ✅ Solution: Add Test User

### Step 1: Go to OAuth Consent Screen
I've opened the OAuth consent screen page for you. If it didn't open, go to:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

### Step 2: Add Test User
1. Scroll down to the **"Test users"** section
2. Click **"+ ADD USERS"**
3. Add your email: `ekosolarize@gmail.com`
4. Click **"SAVE"**

### Step 3: Test Sign-In
1. Go to your app: http://localhost:3000
2. Try Google sign-in again
3. It should work now!

## 🔄 Alternative: Switch to Production (Optional)
If you want anyone to sign in (not just test users):
1. In OAuth consent screen, click **"PUBLISH APP"**
2. This moves it from Testing to Production
3. No test users needed

## 📝 Current Status
- ✅ NEXTAUTH_URL: Fixed to localhost:3000
- ✅ Google Console URIs: Configured correctly
- ✅ Environment variables: All present
- 🔧 **FIXING NOW**: Add test user to bypass verification

## 🎉 Expected Result
After adding `ekosolarize@gmail.com` as a test user, Google sign-in will work immediately!
