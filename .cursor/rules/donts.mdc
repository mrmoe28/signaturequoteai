# Don'ts for this project

## General Development
- Don't remove or replace anything without user consent
- Don't replace secret keys or remove them unless I ask
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript - always use proper typing 
- Don't commit sensitive data like API keys or passwords
- Don't use `console.log` in production code - use the logger utility instead
- Don't create new Vercel projects - only the user creates them

## Next.js Specific
- Don't use Pages Router - always use App Router
- Don't use class components - always use functional components
- Don't use `useEffect` for data fetching - use server components or React Query
- Don't use `unwrap` in Rust code

## Database & API
- Don't write raw SQL queries - use Drizzle ORM
- Don't forget to add proper indexes for performance
- Don't expose sensitive data in API responses

## Email & Authentication
- Don't hardcode email credentials in the codebase

- Don't store OAuth tokens in localStorage - use secure HTTP-only cookies

## File Management
- Don't move or delete files unless explicitly instructed
- Don't create documentation files unless explicitly requested
